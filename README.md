  Introduction

"Cruising Dystopia" is an interactive digital installation inspired by the themes of Esteban Muñoz's "Cruising Utopia" and the historical context of cruising in London parks, specifically Hampstead Heath.

  Background

The project aims to recreate the secretive essence of cruising, portraying the act as akin to an animal hunting in the woods. It is an artistic reflection on queer theory and the cultural history of cruising.

  Technical Details

- Programming Languages: C++, leveraging openFrameworks for creative coding.
- Software Tools: Final Cut for video editing, Ableton for sound design.
- Core Files:
  - `main.cpp`: Initializes the openFrameworks environment and sets up the application window.
  - `ofApp.cpp` and `ofApp.h`: Contain the main logic of the application, including 3D mesh generation, camera movement, lighting effects, and interaction logic.
  - `helpers.cpp` and `helpers.h`: Utility functions for noise generation, normal calculations, and vertex manipulation, enhancing the visual and interactive elements of the installation.
- Lighting and Interaction:
  - Dynamic lighting effects and material properties adjustments, contributing to the immersive experience.
  - Interaction logic involves face tracking and viewer movement in relation to the projection.

  Installation and Setup

- Ideal Setup: A dark room with a large projection screen and a surround sound system.
- Hardware: Kinect camera for face tracking, high-quality projector and speakers.

  Concept

The installation immerses the audience in a digital representation of cruising, featuring dynamic visual elements, a 3D environment, and an auditory landscape, challenging traditional perceptions of public and private spaces in queer contexts.

  Usage

- Visitors interact with the installation through movement and face tracking, triggering changes in the visual and auditory elements, simulating the experience of cruising.
